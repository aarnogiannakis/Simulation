This project involves developing a simulation model to optimize hospital bed distribution, including the introduction of a new ward, Ward F. 
The model will assess the impact on patient flow, including bed occupancy rates, admissions, and relocations, while prioritizing wards based on urgency points.
Sensitivity analyses will evaluate the effects of varying key parameters, guiding decisions on resource allocation to enhance hospital efficiency and patient care
