# Simulation

\section{Primary Tasks}
\subsection{Simulation model}
The simulation model was designed to replicate the flow of inpatients through the hospital. Each ward has a fixed bed capacity, and patient arrivals follow an exponential distribution with specific rates. The length of stay for patients is also exponentially distributed. If a ward reaches its full capacity, patients are either relocated to alternative wards or lost from the system.
